# üçá Vineyard Site Selection Analysis in Central Otago (GIS Project)

This GIS project analyzes vineyard site suitability in Central Otago, New Zealand ‚Äî one of the world‚Äôs southernmost wine regions. Using spatial data and regression models, we identified and quantified the geographic factors influencing vineyard distribution across six sub-regions.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Digitize and classify vineyard areas in Central Otago.
- Analyze 8 environmental factors (slope, soil type, elevation, aspect, precipitation, etc.).
- Apply OLS and GWR models to identify both global and localized influences.
- Generate spatial insights and suitability maps to support vineyard planning.

## üß∞ Tools & Techniques

- **Software**: ArcGIS Pro
- **Methods**: Zonal Statistics, OLS Regression, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)
- **Key Factors**: Slope, Soil Type, Aspect, Elevation, Precipitation, Temperature, Distance to Water, Soil Temperature (January)

## üß™ Analysis Workflow

1. **Study Area and Sub-Region Digitization**  
   Mapped vineyard boundaries across Central Otago and categorized them into 6 key sub-regions using aerial imagery and administrative boundaries.

2. **Geographic Factor Extraction**  
   Selected 8 environmental factors (e.g., slope, temperature, precipitation) and calculated Zonal Statistics per vineyard polygon.

3. **Statistical Modeling**  
   Applied OLS regression to evaluate global relationships and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to identify spatially varying influences across sub-regions.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**  
   Created suitability maps and residual plots to compare model performance and generate practical insights for vineyard planning.

## üìä Key Insights

- **OLS Results**: Distance to water, precipitation, slope, and soil type are significant at the regional level.
- **GWR Results**: Factor influences vary by sub-region; January soil temperature is critical in some zones.
- **Model Fit**: GWR achieved higher explanatory power (Adjusted R¬≤ = 0.27) than OLS, highlighting the importance of spatial heterogeneity.
